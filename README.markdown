This was originally going to be a Wowhead-scraping World of Warcraft gear calculator and grapher. Unfortunately,
scraping Wowhead’s absolutely terrible source-code turned out to be impossible.

This repo still exhibits a neat little HTML5/JavaScript/Node.js live-page example wherein you can get the same
results by “AJAX”-y navigation within the site, or visiting a static URL from a bookmark or an external link. Of
note, in the latter case, the content is static HTML; no JavaScript required, yet you end up with the same
results as if you’d used “AJAX.”
